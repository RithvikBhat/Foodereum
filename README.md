# Foodereum

Foodereum is an Ethereum-based authentication system for food programmes that allow organisations to record, track and authenticate food products along the supply chain. Since immutability is a virtue of the blockchain, transactions cannot be tampered or hidden because every transaction is recorded in a distributed ledger, which also can be traced and revealed to the whole network who have access to the data. This implies that anytime a product is delivered, a new receiver will be able to view the product's entire history on the blockchain network.
